        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Tempeh Stir Fry makes for an easy Asian themed healthy dinner ready in under 30 minutes. Made with Gailan and mushrooms, topped with a creamy spicy tahini sauce. Gluten Free and Vegan. </p>
            <p>For those not familiar with it, tempeh, like tofu is a soy based product, but this one is fermenting cooked soybeans and then forming the mixture into a firm, dense cake. By itself tempeh has a strong nutty taste that can seem a bit dry, but it happens to be excellent at absorbing other flavors making it perfect in an Asian stir fry recipe.</p>
